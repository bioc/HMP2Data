# To Do

- Create a private repository `HMP2Data_supplement`
- Put there the `data_processing.Rmd` vignette and the corresponding data processing files
- Put there the data files (except biom files) needed for the data processing files to work (look inside them)
- MD will put Methods in the README.md of this repository
- We will refer to it from the main package page
