# To Do


- Make frequency table similar to `table_one` in https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/vignettes/HMP16SData/inst/doc/HMP16SData.html
    - Columns - MOMSPI, IBD, T2D studies, number and %.
    - Rows - all parameters by visit. 
    - Make a separate table for visits only for those three studies, with 67 visits breakdown.

- Add matrices for IBD and T2D studies
    - describe their use in the vignette
