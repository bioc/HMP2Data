# To Do

- Frequency Table 1 - add row "Total", showing the total number of subjects in each study, 100% of all subjects

- Frequency Table 1 and 2 - make study headers prettier, like "MOMS-PI 16S"

- Make three frequency histograms of visits, one for each study. Each bin should represent one visit type, i.e., show how many are "visit 1", "visit 2", etc. Use ggplot. 

- Describe in the vignette how to invoke vignettes. `browseVignettes("HMP2Data")` doesn't work.
    - Even after installing like: `devtools::install_github("jstansfield0/HMP2Data", auth_token = "e1ef7c328f2c14b2627ad113093b65726f9e24d3", build_vignettes = TRUE)`, vignettes still cannot be found:
```
> library(HMP2Data)
> browseVignettes("HMP2Data")
No vignettes found by browseVignettes("HMP2Data")
```


- Create a vignette about data processing. Include processing scripts as non-exportable files.
    - From `mdozmorov/HMP2` repository, use `preprocess_biom_16S.Rmd`, `preprocess_phyloseq_16S.Rmd`, `preprocess_cytokines.Rmd`, `read_ibd_t2d_biom.Rmd`.
    - Reorganize the code into a more streamlined set of files, rename, split, combine files, as appropriate.
    - Make the code generic, e.g., remove absolute paths, add `path/to/something` with comments.
    - Describe the use of these files in the vignette.
