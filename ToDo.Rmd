# To Do

- Frequency Table 1 - add row "Total", showing the total number of subjects in each study, 100% of all subjects

- Frequency Table 1 and 2 - make study headers prettier, like "MOMS-PI 16S"

- Make three frequency histograms of visits, one for each study. Each bin should represent one visit type, i.e., show how many are "visit 1", "visit 2", etc. Use ggplot. 

- Create a vignette about data processing. Include processing scripts as non-exportable files.
    - From `mdozmorov/HMP2` repository, use `preprocess_biom_16S.Rmd`, `preprocess_phyloseq_16S.Rmd`, `preprocess_cytokines.Rmd`, `read_ibd_t2d_biom.Rmd`.
    - Reorganize the code into a more streamlined set of files, rename, split, combine files, as appropriate.
    - Make the code generic, e.g., remove absolute paths, add `path/to/something` with comments.
    - Describe the use of these files in the vignette.
