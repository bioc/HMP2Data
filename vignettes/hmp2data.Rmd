# Exporting Data to CSV, SAS, SPSS, and STATA Formats

To our knowledge, R and Bioconductor provide the most and best methods for the
analysis of microbiome data. However, we realize they are not the only analysis
environments and wish to provide methods to export the data from
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("HMP16SData")` to CSV, SAS, SPSS, and STATA formats. As we
do not use these other languages regularly, we are unaware of how to represent
phylogenitic trees in them and will not attempt to export the trees here.
